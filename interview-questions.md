# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions


First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: Parameters are the placeholders for the values that will go into a fuction while the arguments are the actual values that are being plugged into the fuctions.

  Researched answer: Parameters are part of the fuction definition. Arguments are outside of the fuction and they are the actual values that are passed into the fuction to create an output.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The .map() meothod requires an array as a perameter off the top of my head im not remimbering the addtional parameters

  Researched answer: The .map method can take up to three parameters. the first is "currentValue" this is a required parameter and  holds the value of current element. The second parameter is "index" this is an optional parameter and it holds the index location of the element. The third parameter is "arr" It is optional parameter and it holds the array.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: .map returns an array that contains the same number of array items as the orginal array while .filter (usually) returns an array that has fewer array items than the orginal

  Researched answer: .map changes an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new array. The new array will have the same length as the input array, but its content will have been mapped to a new form by the function.  .fliter uses the argument named test, a function value, to fill a “gap” in the computation—the process of deciding which elements to collect. .filter, rather than deleting elements from the existing array, builds up a new array with only the elements that pass the test. It does not modify the array it is given.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: Methods are functions that "live" inside of objects, while functions can be found outside of objects.

  Researched answer: A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences: First a method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called. Secondly A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class.

5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is the processes of taking values from an object and breaking them down into a variable.

  Researched answer: JavaScript Object Destructuring is the syntax for extracting values from an object property and assigning them to a variable. The destructuring is also possible for JavaScript Arrays.


6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: ?

  Researched answer: Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Class inheritance is a way for one class to extend another class.

2. React:React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components.

3. React state: React components has a built-in state object. The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.

4. React lifecycle methods: Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

5. DOM: DOM stands for ‘Document Object Model’. In simple terms, it is a structured representation of the HTML elements that are present in a webpage or web-app.
